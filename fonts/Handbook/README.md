# DEC Handbook font

This is a reconstruction of the font used on DEC processor handbook
covers and other manuals in the early 1970s.  Some characters did not
appear in the originals (like "x") so they are made up in the style of
the others.

This is a lower case only font.  A few letters have alternate shapes,
with short and long curving parts.  The long curve shapes are the
lower case letters; these are suitable for the end of a word (f r t)
and the start (j).  The corresponding upper case letters are for use
in the middle of a word.
